Amos Mosaner, a curler from Trento, etched his name into history alongside his partner Stefania Constantini by winning Italy’s first-ever gold medal in curling at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The duo, hailing from a country with little curling tradition, achieved this milestone in the mixed doubles event, going undefeated throughout the tournament. Mosaner’s journey from Trento, a city known more for its stunning landscapes than winter sports, to Olympic glory is a testament to his dedication and the remarkable partnership with Constantini that inspired Italians to embrace the sport.
