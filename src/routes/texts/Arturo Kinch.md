Arturo Kinch, a trailblazer for athletes from tropical nations, made history as a cross-country skier and alpine skier representing Costa Rica in the Winter Olympics. His most remarkable achievement came off the slopes when he successfully convinced the International Olympic Committee to allow countries without snow to compete in the Winter Games. Kinch’s determination to bring inclusivity to the global sporting stage paved the way for athletes from non-traditional winter sports nations to pursue their Olympic dreams. Competing in four Winter Olympics (1980, 1984, 1988, and 2006), Kinch’s tenacity and passion for skiing not only represented Costa Rica but also inspired countless others from unlikely regions to challenge conventions and aim for the Olympic spotlight.
