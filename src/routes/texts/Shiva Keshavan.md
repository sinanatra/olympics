Shiva Keshavan, India’s pioneering luge athlete, made history not just for his sport but also for his unique Olympic journey. At just 16, he debuted in the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics, competing under the banner of “Individual Olympic Athletes” after India’s Olympic committee faced suspension. This unusual status marked him as a symbol of determination, representing his country independently while navigating a sport with no infrastructure or recognition in India. Over his six Winter Olympics appearances, he overcame immense challenges, from self-engineering his equipment to training in makeshift conditions, all while setting Asian speed records. Shiva’s story exemplifies the spirit of perseverance, proving that passion can prevail even in the face of adversity.
