Sonja Henie, the Norwegian figure skating prodigy, dazzled the world when she competed in her first Winter Olympics at just 11 years old in Chamonix in 1924. Though she did not medal then, her unparalleled talent soon flourished as she went on to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in 1928 (St. Moritz), 1932 (Lake Placid), and 1936 (Garmisch-Partenkirchen). Henie’s youthful grace and innovative routines revolutionized figure skating, blending athleticism with artistry. After dominating the sport, she transitioned seamlessly into a career in Hollywood, becoming a major box-office star in the 1930s and 1940s with her ice-themed musicals. Beyond her athletic and cinematic successes, Henie’s legacy endures as a trailblazer who transformed figure skating into a global spectacle and inspired generations to follow in her gliding footsteps.
